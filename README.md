Statistics with Python â€“ Country Profile Variables Dataset
This repository contains my practice work exploring descriptive and inferential statistics using Python, based on the Country Profile Variables dataset.

Key Highlights
Descriptive Statistics:
Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)
Distribution analysis

Data Visualization:
Boxplots, and Heatmap
Identifying patterns and relationships in the data

Tools Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for calculations
Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

Goal
To strengthen my understanding of statistical methods and their practical implementation in Python using real-world datasets.
